Various Fixs and Tweaks to BOOX as a Xposed module

*Only tested on Max3.*

*Since BOOX OS does not allow EdXposed Manager to automatically take action after an app is installed/upgraded, please go to EdXposed Manager - Modules and press "refresh" button after you install/upgrade this module (as well as other Xposed modules).*

- Fixes crash when tapping navigation bar button after enabling navigation bar
- Make `Alt+Tab` able to bring up Overview (Recent Task Switcher)
- Allow changing the E-Ink optimization configuration for system(whitelisted) apps (Be careful!)
